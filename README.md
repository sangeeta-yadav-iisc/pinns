# L30: Neural Network–based Solvers for Convection–Diffusion Systems

This repository accompanies **Lecture 30** on *Neural Network-based Solvers for Convection–Diffusion Systems*.
It demonstrates how **Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)** can be used to solve a 1D convection–diffusion equation.

---

## 📘 Problem Statement

We solve the steady 1D convection–diffusion equation:

\[
-\\varepsilon u''(x) + b u'(x) = f(x), \quad x \\in (0,1)
\]

with boundary conditions:

\[
u(0) = 0, \quad u(1) = 0
\]

## 🧠 Methodology

- A fully connected neural network approximates the solution \( u(x) \)
- PDE residuals are enforced via **automatic differentiation**
- Boundary conditions are imposed through the loss function
- No mesh or numerical discretization is required
